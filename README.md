# UCI-Registration
Registration Project - my version
I've just reinstalled Eclipse with Java.  Previous version wasn't working.
Now I need to work with Github
I'm trying to create a readme file and loaded it onto Github
Afterwards will try to load a file from Eclipse to GitHub.
Later I'll try to clone our assignment and run it looking for errors.
